# Choice of 2 river networks
To create the habitat database we use two river networks in parallel.
The Hydrological data and maps based on SHuttle Elevation Derivatives at multiple Scales (**HydroSHEDS**) and **EU-Hydro** from Copernicus (European Union's Earth Observation Programme).

**EU-Hydro**, being an European only dataset, will not include the Southern Mediterranean.

# HydroSHEDS
## Data description
**HydroSHEDS** is a global database providing high-resolution hydrographic data derived from NASA's Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM). Covering most land areas, it offers structured datasets for hydrological modeling, watershed analysis, and environmental research. The data is available at resolutions up to 3 arc-seconds (~90m) in raster (GeoTIFF) and vector (shapefiles,geodatabases) formats. 
We use the geodatabases format. It includes river networks, watershed boundaries, drainage directions, and flow accumulation. Core products include **HydroBASINS** for watershed boundaries, **HydroRIVERS** for river networks, **HydroLAKES** for lakes and reservoirs, and **HydroATLAS**, which adds environmental attributes.

## Importing HydroSHEDS
The first thing is to download and process the hydrological network from the **HydroSHEDS** website. To do so we create a PowerShell script that iterates through predefined file IDs (`$files`) and corresponding dataset types (`$atlas`), constructing download URLs and filenames dynamically. The script navigates to the source directory, downloads each dataset as a ZIP file using `curl`, extracts it to a specified output directory, and then connects to the PostgreSQL database (`diaspara`). Within the database, it ensures a clean schema by dropping any existing schema of the same name and recreating it for fresh data import.

<details> 
<summary>PowerShell code to download HydroSHEDS</summary>

```{.ps1 include="../bash/0_powershell_import_hydroatlas.ps1"}
```
</details> 

The same process is used to import a country layer and ICES divisions.
ICES divisions are downloaded from the ICES website.

## Inserting data
Then we insert the downloaded data to the database. To do so we use `ogr2ogr`, a command-line tool from the GDAL library, to import geospatial data from File Geodatabases (GDB) into a PostgreSQL database. Each command processes a different dataset—**BasinATLAS, RiverATLAS, and LakeATLAS**—and loads them into corresponding schemas within the **DIASPARA** database.  

The `-f "PostgreSQL"` specifies the output format, while `-a_srs EPSG:4326` ensures the spatial reference system is set to WGS 84 (EPSG:4326). The `-lco SCHEMA="..."` option places each dataset into a designated schema (`basinatlas`, `riveratlas`, `lakeatlas`). The `-overwrite` flag ensures any existing data in the schema is replaced. The `-progress` option provides real-time feedback during execution. Lastly, `--config PG_USE_COPY YES` optimizes performance by using PostgreSQL's `COPY` command for faster data insertion.

<details>
<summary>Code to import data to the database</summary>

```{.ps1 include="../bash/1_osgeo4w_ogr2ogr_gdb_postgres_hydroatlas.ps1"}
```
</details>

The same process is used to insert other downloaded data to the database.


## Building the database
Once the data downloaded we choose to to split the database into smaller groups following ICES Areas and Ecoregions.

### Step 1 : Spliting data into smaller groups for efficiency (Europe/N.Africa)

European hydrological data are extracted by first selecting large-scale catchments from `basinatlas.basinatlas_v10_lev03`, a layer representing coarse-resolution catchments at level 3. We filtered these catchments based on specific `hybas_id` values and stored them in a temporary table `tempo.hydro_large_catchments_europe`. Next, we refine our selection by extracting smaller, more detailed catchments from `basinatlas.basinatlas_v10_lev12`, which represents the most detailed level (level 12) of the HydroBASINS hierarchy. We ensure that these smaller catchments are spatially contained within the large catchments using `ST_Within`, saving them in `tempo.hydro_small_catchments_europe`, and add a GIST index on geometries to improve spatial query efficiency. Finally, we select river segments from `riveratlas.riveratlas_v10` that intersect with the chosen small catchments using `ST_Intersects`, storing the results in `tempo.hydro_riversegments_europe`.

```{sql}
#| label: smaller groups
#| code-summary: Code to split data into smaller entities
#| echo: TRUE
#| eval: FALSE
#| warning: FALSE
#| message: FALSE

-- Selecting european data from hydroatlas (large catchments)
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS tempo.hydro_large_catchments_europe;
CREATE TABLE tempo.hydro_large_catchments_europe AS(
SELECT shape FROM basinatlas.basinatlas_v10_lev03
WHERE hybas_id = ANY(ARRAY[2030000010,2030003440,2030005690,2030006590,
              2030006600,2030007930,2030007940,2030008490,2030008500,
							2030009230,2030012730,2030014550,2030016230,2030018240,2030020320,2030024230,2030026030,2030028220,

);--35

-- Selecting european data from hydroatlas (small catchments)
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS tempo.hydro_small_catchments_europe;
CREATE TABLE tempo.hydro_small_catchments_europe AS (
SELECT * FROM basinatlas.basinatlas_v10_lev12 ba
WHERE EXISTS (
  SELECT 1
  FROM tempo.hydro_large_catchments_europe hlce
  WHERE ST_Within(ba.shape,hlce.shape)
  )
);--78055
CREATE INDEX idx_tempo_hydro_small_catchments_europe ON tempo.hydro_small_catchments_europe USING GIST(shape);

-- Selecting european data from riveratlas
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS tempo.hydro_riversegments_europe;
CREATE TABLE tempo.hydro_riversegments_europe AS(
	SELECT * FROM riveratlas.riveratlas_v10 r
	WHERE EXISTS (
		SELECT 1
		FROM tempo.hydro_small_catchments_europe e
		WHERE ST_Intersects(r.geom,e.shape)
	)
); --589947
```

The same method is used to select catchemnts and river segments in the Southern Mediterranean area.

![Map of all catchemnts present in the database.](images/fig-all_catchments.png "A view of all European and Northern African catchments "){#fig-all_catchments}

### Step 2 : Selecting the most downstream riversegment for each reach

Next we need to extract the most downstream river segments from `tempo.hydro_riversegments_europe`. To achieve this, we filter the table to retain only the river segments where `hyriv_id` is equal to `main_riv`, which correspond to the most downstream river segment of the river basin, ensuring that for each reach, only its most downstream segment is selected. The results are then stored in `tempo.riveratlas_mds`.

```{sql}
#| label: most downstream rivers
#| code-summary: Code to select the most downstream river segments
#| echo: TRUE
#| eval: FALSE
#| warning: FALSE
#| message: FALSE

DROP TABLE IF EXISTS tempo.riveratlas_mds;
CREATE TABLE tempo.riveratlas_mds AS (
	SELECT *
	FROM tempo.hydro_riversegments_europe
	WHERE hydro_riversegments_europe.hyriv_id = hydro_riversegments_europe.main_riv); --17344
```

The same method is used for Southern Mediterranean data.

![Map of most downstream river segments in the Baltic area.](images/fig-mds_baltic.png "A view of the Baltic with the most downstream river segments highlighted"){#fig-mds_baltic}

### Step 3 : Creating a most downstream point

To identify the most downstream point for each river segment in `tempo.riveratlas_mds`, a new column, `downstream_point`, is added to store the point geometry (EPSG:4326). The last coordinate of each segment’s geometry was extracted using `ST_PointN` on the cut down line geometry from `ST_Dump`, ensuring that the most downstream point is correctly identified. The table is then updated by assigning the extracted downstream point to the corresponding `hyriv_id`. Finally, a GIST index on `downstream_point` is created to improve the efficiency of spatial queries.

```{sql}
#| label: most downstream point
#| code-summary: Code to create the most downstream point
#| echo: TRUE
#| eval: FALSE
#| warning: FALSE
#| message: FALSE

ALTER TABLE tempo.riveratlas_mds
	ADD COLUMN downstream_point geometry(Point, 4326);
WITH downstream_points AS (
    SELECT 
        hyriv_id,
        ST_PointN((ST_Dump(geom)).geom, ST_NumPoints((ST_Dump(geom)).geom)) AS downstream_point
    FROM tempo.riveratlas_mds
)
UPDATE tempo.riveratlas_mds AS t
	SET downstream_point = dp.downstream_point
	FROM downstream_points AS dp
	WHERE t.hyriv_id = dp.hyriv_id; --17344

CREATE INDEX idx_tempo_riveratlas_mds_dwnstrm ON tempo.riveratlas_mds USING GIST(downstream_point);
```

The same method is used for Southern Mediterranean data.

![Map of most downstream points in the Baltic area.](images/fig-mdp_baltic.png "A view of the Baltic with the most downstream points highlighted"){#fig-mdp_baltic}

### Step 4 : Intersecting the most downstream point with wanted ICES areas

#### Baltic

ICES divisions are already used in the Baltic by WGBAST thus we have kept this same structure. It is divided in three areas grouping together ICES divisions 30 & 31 ; 27,28,29 & 32 and 22,24,25 & 26.

![Map of ICES fishing areas at subdivision level, source NAFO, FAO, ICES, GFCM.](images/fig-ices_baltic.png "A view of the Baltic with ICES fishing subdivision"){#fig-ices_baltic}

A new table, `tempo.ices_areas_3229_27`, is created by selecting river segments from `tempo.riveratlas_mds` where the `downstream_point` of each segment is within a specified distance (0.01 units) of the geometry in `ices_areas."ices_areas_20160601_cut_dense_3857"`. The selection is further restricted to areas with specific `subdivisio` values ('32', '29', '28', '27'). Additionally, to avoid duplicates, only segments whose `downstream_point` is not already present in `tempo.ices_areas_3031` are included.
The same method is used for the whole Baltic area.

```{sql}
#| label: baltic downstream points
#| code-summary: Code to retrieve most downstream points for 27, 28, 29 & 32 ICES areas
#| eval: FALSE
#| echo: TRUE
#| warning: FALSE
#| message: FALSE

CREATE TABLE tempo.ices_areas_3229_27 AS (
	SELECT dp.*
	FROM tempo.riveratlas_mds AS dp
	JOIN ices_areas."ices_areas_20160601_cut_dense_3857" AS ia
	ON ST_DWithin(
	    dp.downstream_point,
	    ia.geom,
	    0.01
	)
	WHERE ia.subdivisio=ANY(ARRAY['32','29','28','27'])
	AND dp.downstream_point NOT IN (
		SELECT existing.downstream_point
	    FROM tempo.ices_areas_3031 AS existing)
); --569
```


![Map of most downstream points in the Northern Baltic ICES area.](images/fig-mdp_baltic2732.png "A view of the Northern Baltic with the most downstream points highlighted"){#fig-mdp_baltic2732}

#### Ecoregions

For the rest of the dataset, ICES ecoregions are used to group catchments and river segments together.

![Map of ICES fishing ecoregions.](images/fig-ices_ecoregions.png "A view of Europe and Northern Africa with ICES fishing ecoregions"){#fig-ices_ecoregions}

The most downstream points are gathered from `tempo.riveratlas_mds`, applying three filters: a country filter, an ICES ecoregion filter, and an exclusion condition.  

First, we retrieve distinct downstream points that are within 0.04 degrees of the geometries in `ices_ecoregions.ices_ecoregions_20171207_erase_esri`, specifically selecting `objectid = 11`, which corresponded to the desired ICES ecoregion. Additionally, these points have to be within 0.02 degrees of the geometries in `tempo.ne_10m_admin_0_countries`, ensuring they are located in Norway or Sweden.  

Similarly, we selecte downstream points that are within 0.04 degrees of the geometries in `ices_areas.ices_areas_20160601_cut_dense_3857`, specifically for `subdivisio = '23'`, while also ensuring they are within 0.02 degrees of Norway or Sweden. This is done because of an overlap between ICES ecoregions and ICES areas in this particular zone. 

Finally, we combine both sets of points while applying an exclusion condition: any points from the ICES area selection that already exist in the ICES ecoregion selection are removed, ensuring no duplicates are kept, while maintaining priority for the ecoregion-based selection. The resulting dataset `tempo.ices_ecoregions_nsea_north` contains the most downstream points filtered by ICES ecoregions, ICES areas, and country boundaries for Norway and Sweden.

```{sql}
#| label: northern north sea downstream points
#| code-summary: Code to retrieve most downstream points for the Northern part of the North Sea ICES ecoregion
#| eval: FALSE
#| echo: TRUE
#| warning: FALSE
#| message: FALSE

CREATE TABLE tempo.ices_ecoregions_nsea_north AS (
    WITH ecoregion_points AS (
        SELECT DISTINCT dp.*
        FROM tempo.riveratlas_mds AS dp
        JOIN ices_ecoregions."ices_ecoregions_20171207_erase_esri" AS er
        ON ST_DWithin(
            dp.downstream_point,
            er.geom,
            0.04
        )
        JOIN tempo.ne_10m_admin_0_countries AS cs
        ON ST_DWithin(
            dp.downstream_point,
            cs.geom,
            0.02
        )
        WHERE er.objectid = 11
          AND cs.name IN ('Norway','Sweden')
    ),
    area_points AS (
        SELECT DISTINCT dp.*
        FROM tempo.riveratlas_mds AS dp
        JOIN ices_areas."ices_areas_20160601_cut_dense_3857" AS ia
        ON ST_DWithin(
            dp.downstream_point,
            ia.geom,
            0.04
        )
        JOIN tempo.ne_10m_admin_0_countries AS cs
        ON ST_DWithin(
            dp.downstream_point,
            cs.geom,
            0.02
        )
        WHERE ia.subdivisio = '23'
          AND cs.name IN ('Norway','Sweden')
    )
    SELECT * FROM ecoregion_points
    UNION
    SELECT * FROM area_points
    WHERE downstream_point NOT IN (
        SELECT downstream_point FROM ecoregion_points
    )
);--1271
```

![Map of most downstream points in the Northern Sea.](images/fig-mdp_ecoregions.png "A view of the Northern Sea with the most downstream points highlighted"){#fig-mdp_ecoregions}

### Step 4.5 : Repeating the intersection using a larger buffer to retrieve missing points

#### Baltic

We select the most downstream points from `tempo.riveratlas_mds` that are within a larger buffer of 0.1 degrees of the geometries in `ices_areas.ices_areas_20160601_cut_dense_3857`, specifically for `subdivisio` values 32, 29, and 28 (subdivision 27 being already complete).

To avoid duplication, we compile a list of excluded points by gathering all downstream points already present in several existing tables: `tempo.ices_areas_26_22`, `tempo.ices_areas_3229_27`, `tempo.ices_areas_3031`, `tempo.ices_ecoregions_barent`, `tempo.ices_ecoregions_nsea_north`, and `tempo.ices_ecoregions_norwegian`.  

We then identify the missing points by filtering out any downstream points from our selection that match an already excluded point. This ensures that only new and unique points were retained.  
Finally, we insert these missing points into `tempo.ices_areas_3229_27`.


```{sql}
#| eval: FALSE
#| echo: TRUE
#| code-summary: Code to retrieve missing most downstream points for 27, 28, 29 & 32 ICES areas using a larger buffer
#| warning: FALSE
#| message: FALSE

WITH filtered_points AS (
    SELECT dp.*
    FROM tempo.riveratlas_mds AS dp
    JOIN ices_areas."ices_areas_20160601_cut_dense_3857" AS ia
    ON ST_DWithin(
        dp.downstream_point,
        ST_Transform(ia.geom, 4326),
        0.1
    )
    WHERE ia.subdivisio = ANY(ARRAY['32', '29', '28'])
),
excluded_points AS (
    SELECT downstream_point
    FROM tempo.ices_areas_26_22
    UNION ALL
    SELECT downstream_point FROM tempo.ices_areas_3229_27
    UNION ALL
    SELECT downstream_point FROM tempo.ices_areas_3031
    UNION ALL
    SELECT downstream_point FROM tempo.ices_ecoregions_barent
    UNION ALL
    SELECT downstream_point FROM tempo.ices_ecoregions_nsea_north
    UNION ALL
    SELECT downstream_point FROM tempo.ices_ecoregions_norwegian
),
missing_points AS (
    SELECT fp.*
    FROM filtered_points AS fp
    LEFT JOIN excluded_points AS ep
    ON ST_Equals(fp.downstream_point, ep.downstream_point)
    WHERE ep.downstream_point IS NULL
)
INSERT INTO tempo.ices_areas_3229_27
SELECT mp.*
FROM missing_points AS mp;--8
```


#### Ecoregions

We select distinct downstream points from `tempo.riveratlas_mds` using two spatial filters. The first selection includes points within 0.1 degrees of `ices_ecoregions.ices_ecoregions_20171207_erase_esri`, specifically for `objectid = 11`, and also within the larger buffer of 0.1 degrees of `tempo.ne_10m_admin_0_countries`, ensuring they are in Norway or Sweden.  

The second selection included points within 0.1 degrees of `ices_areas.ices_areas_20160601_cut_dense_3857`, specifically for `subdivisio = '23'`, while also ensuring proximity to Norway or Sweden. Both selections are merged to form the set of filtered points.  

To prevent duplication, we compile a list of excluded points by gathering all downstream points already present in several tables: `tempo.ices_areas_26_22`, `tempo.ices_areas_3229_27`, `tempo.ices_areas_3031`, `tempo.ices_ecoregions_barent`, `tempo.ices_ecoregions_nsea_north`, `tempo.ices_ecoregions_norwegian`, and `tempo.ices_ecoregions_nsea_south`.  

We then identify missing points by removing any downstream points from our selection that match an already excluded point. This ensures that only new and unique points were retained.  

Finally, we insert these missing points into `tempo.ices_ecoregions_nsea_north`, adding new downstream points that meet the criteria while avoiding duplicates.

```{sql}
#| eval: FALSE
#| echo: TRUE

    SELECT DISTINCT dp.*

    ON ST_DWithin(
        dp.downstream_point,
        ST_Transform(er.geom, 4326),
        0.1
    )
    JOIN tempo.ne_10m_admin_0_countries AS cs
    ON ST_DWithin(
        dp.downstream_point,
        ST_Transform(cs.geom, 4326),
        0.1
    )
    WHERE er.objectid = 11
      AND cs.name IN ('Norway', 'Sweden')

    UNION

        0.1
    )
    JOIN tempo.ne_10m_admin_0_countries AS cs
    ON ST_DWithin(
        dp.downstream_point,
        ST_Transform(cs.geom, 4326),
        0.1
    )
    WHERE ia.subdivisio = '23'
      AND cs.name IN ('Norway', 'Sweden')
),
excluded_points AS (
    SELECT downstream_point FROM tempo.ices_areas_26_22
    UNION ALL
    SELECT downstream_point FROM tempo.ices_areas_3229_27
    UNION ALL
    SELECT downstream_point FROM tempo.ices_areas_3031
    UNION ALL
    SELECT downstream_point FROM tempo.ices_ecoregions_barent
    UNION ALL
    SELECT downstream_point FROM tempo.ices_ecoregions_nsea_north
    UNION ALL
    SELECT downstream_point FROM tempo.ices_ecoregions_norwegian
    UNION ALL
    SELECT downstream_point FROM tempo.ices_ecoregions_nsea_south
),
missing_points AS (
    SELECT fp.*
    FROM filtered_points AS fp
    LEFT JOIN excluded_points AS ep
    ON ST_Equals(fp.downstream_point, ep.downstream_point)
    WHERE ep.downstream_point IS NULL
)
INSERT INTO tempo.ices_ecoregions_nsea_north
SELECT mp.*
FROM missing_points AS mp;
```

### Step 5 : Copy all riversegments corresponding to the previously selected riversegments using the main_riv identifier

A new schema `h_baltic_3229_27` is created to store the selected river segments. Within this schema, we create the `riversegments` table by selecting distinct river segments from `tempo.hydro_riversegments_europe` that match the `main_riv` values found in `tempo.ices_areas_3229_27`. This ensures that only river segments associated with the relevant ICES subdivisions are included.  

To optimize the table, we add a primary key constraint on `hyriv_id`, ensuring data integrity and uniqueness. Additionally, two indexes are created: a **B-tree** index on `main_riv` to improve lookup efficiency and a **GIST** index on `geom` to speed up spatial queries.

### Step 6 : Gather all corresponding catchments using an intersection function

We create the `h_baltic_26_22.catchments` table by selecting distinct small catchments from `tempo.hydro_small_catchments_europe` that intersect with the river segments stored in `h_baltic_26_22.riversegments`. To avoid duplication, we exclude any catchments that were already present in `h_baltic_3031.catchments` or `h_baltic_3229_27.catchments`.  

To improve performance and maintain data integrity, we add a primary key constraint on `hybas_id`. Additionally, we created a **B-tree** index on `main_bas` to optimize lookups and a **GIST** index on `shape` to enhance spatial query efficiency.

```{sql}

CREATE INDEX idx_h_baltic_26_22_catchments_main_bas ON h_baltic_26_22.catchments USING BTREE(main_bas);
CREATE INDEX idx_h_baltic_26_22_catchments ON h_baltic_26_22.catchments USING GIST(shape);
```

### Step 7 : Retrieve all missing endorheic catchments using an evelope

We construct the `tempo.oneendo_bisciber` table by generating a concave hull around the exterior boundary of the merged catchment shapes from `h_biscay_iberian.catchments`. This process creates a generalized polygon representing the area covered by these catchments. To improve spatial query performance, we added a **GIST** index on the geometry column.  

Next, we identify endorheic basins from `basinatlas.basinatlas_v10_lev12` that intersect with `tempo.oneendo_bisciber`. To ensure only relevant basins are selected, we exclude those already present in surrounding areas (`h_biscay_iberian.catchments`, `h_med_west.catchments`, `h_nsea_south.catchments`), and specific basins defined by `main_bas` values 2120017150, 2120017480, and 2120018070 that belong to another area. The remaining filtered basins are then inserted into `h_biscay_iberian.catchments`.

Finally, we populate `h_biscay_iberian.riversegments` by selecting distinct river segments from `tempo.hydro_riversegments_europe` that intersected with the newly added catchments. To prevent duplicate entries, we exclude any river segments that already existed in `h_biscay_iberian.riversegments`.

```{sql}
#| eval: FALSE

### Step 8 : Retrieve all missing islands and coastal catchments not linked to a riversegments by using an intersection with ICES areas

We identify the last set of catchments by selecting distinct small catchments from `tempo.hydro_small_catchments_europe` that intersect with `ices_areas.ices_areas_20160601_cut_dense_3857`, specifically within subdivisions 32, 29, 28, and 27.  

To avoid duplication, we exclude catchments that are already present in `h_baltic_3031.catchments`, `h_baltic_3229_27.catchments`, and `h_baltic_26_22.catchments`. The remaining catchments, which are not already accounted for, are inserted into `h_baltic_3229_27.catchments`.

## Creating a hierarchical structure for WGBAST

Based on the map of catchments, a table is created
to store the referential of habitat, both continental and marine,  
specific to each working group : [hierarchical structure](https://diaspara.bordeaux-aquitaine.inrae.fr/deliverables/wp3/p7/midb.html#area-tr_area_are). This area is meant to be a [referential tables](https://diaspara.bordeaux-aquitaine.inrae.fr/deliverables/wp3/p7/midb.html#referential-tables). Several levels have been layed out (@fig-area_hierarchy_bast) depending on the needs of each working group.

```{dot}
//| label: fig-area_hierarchy_bast

Here we describe how the hierarchical structure is built in the Baltic for **WGBAST**. All the work is done using a table called `refbast.tr_area_are` that references the `ref.tr_area_are` table.

The largest level (which encompasses all others) is the global Stock level (@fig-fullstocklvl). It includes all catchments that have a river flowing into the Baltic (@fig-inlandstocklvl) as well as all ICES subdivisions present in the Baltic (@fig-marinestocklvl). For this reason, in practise this layer is created after the two next lower levels in the hierarchy.

We use this query to merge all geometries (inland and marine stock) in the `refbast.tr_area_are` table into a single shape. First, we apply `ST_Union` to dissolve boundaries between geometries, then extract their exterior rings and convert them into polygons. These are passed through `ST_ConcaveHull` to produce a simplified, more natural outer boundary that better follows the spatial extent. Calculating the area of the resulting geometry and filtering those that are too small (area ≤ 1), ensures only significant shapes are retained and got rid of some small artifacts. The final geometry is wrapped as a `MultiPolygon` and used to update one entry in the table along with metadata fields. Its `are_id` is 1 since it is the highest level of the hierarchy, `are_are_id` is `NULL` because there is no higher level to reference to, its `are_lev_code` is `Stock` and `are_ismarine` is `NULL` as this level is both inland and marine.

```

### Marine level
#### Stock

The global Stock level (@fig-fullstocklvl) is then split into two lower layers. The first one is the marine Stock level (@fig-marinestocklvl)


We insert a new spatial unit into the `refbast.tr_area_are` table to represent a marine stock area labeled **"Baltic marine"**. This unit is associated with the **"Stock"** level (`are_lev_code`) and is marked as marine (`are_ismarine = true`). 
To define its geometry, we aggregate spatial features from the `ref.tr_fishingarea_fia` table using `ST_Union`, specifically targeting geometries where the `fia_level` is `'Division'` and the `fia_division` corresponds to either `'27.3.b, c'` or `'27.3.d'`.
A new unique identifier is generated using the `refbast.seq` sequence for `are_id`, and the new area is linked to the global Stock level through the `are_are_id` of `1`.

#### ICES division

The division level correspond to one line inserted into the `refbast.tr_area_are` table, it corresponds to the fishing area **"27.3.b, c"**. The level of the spatial unit is set to **"Division"**, and it is marked as marine (`are_ismarine = true`). 
The geometry is retrieved from the `ref.tr_fishingarea_fia` table by selecting records where the `fia_level` is `'Division'` and the `fia_division` is `'27.3.b, c'`. This geometry is directly passed into the insert statement without modification. 
The sequence `refbast.seq` keeps generating a new `are_id`, and the area is assigned the parent `are_are_id` of `3`, linking it to the higher-level of structure (@fig-marinestocklvl).

#### ICES subdivision

The same method is applied here to create the subdivision level. To give more flexibility and reusability, the logic is encapsulated in a SQL function. The function `insert_fishing_subdivision` takes two parameters: a `subdiv` text representing the subdivision code suffix (e.g., `'d.31'`), and a parent area ID `p_are_are_id` to define the hierarchical relationship. The subdivision code (`are_code`) is dynamically built by concatenating `'27.3.'` with the input `subdiv`. Unlike the previous division-level query, this function filters geometries where `fia_level = 'Subdivision'`, and inserts the corresponding geometry into the `refbast.tr_area_are` table, while maintaining the correct parent-child linkage through `are_are_id`.

### Continental level
#### Stock

The inland stock level includes all catchments through which rivers flow into the Baltic Sea.
In the query above, we insert a new area into the `refbast.tr_area_are` table with the label `'Baltic inland'` at the `'Stock'` level. The geometry is built by merging (`ST_Union`) all relevant catchments from the `tempo.catchments_baltic` table that inherits from previously built catchment tables. These catchments are selected based on their source tables, identified by the suffixes `'h_baltic30to31'`, `'h_baltic22to26'`, and `'h_baltic27to29_32'`. The resulting geometry is tagged as non-marine (`are_ismarine = false`) to distinguish inland from marine stock areas.

#### Country {#sec-wgbast-country}

This next layer is optional, it is added here as an example to show what it could look like.

A function is created here to insert the country layer into the talbe. This `insert_country_baltic` function takes a country name as input and inserts a new row into the `refbast.tr_area_are` table representing the specified country at the `'Country'` level. It does so by taking the country’s geometry in `ref.tr_country_cou`. The resulting area is non-marine (`are_ismarine = false`), and the function automatically assigns a unique `are_id` from the sequence, while setting the `are_are_id` to `3` to indicate that it is nested under the inland stock level (@fig-inlandstocklvl).

#### Assessment unit

Assessment units have been created by [WGBAST](https://diaspara.bordeaux-aquitaine.inrae.fr/deliverables/wp3/p5/wgbast_database_description.html#assessment-units-within-the-baltic-sea-area) within the Baltic Sea area. There is six of them (@fig-bastassunit) and they are used to retrieve catchments and rivers that are within their areas.
This level does not go lower than the country one but stays at the same level, assessment units stretching across several countries.

![Map of WGBAST assessment units.](images/fig-assunit.png "A view of Scandinavia with polygons representing WGBAST assessment units"){#fig-bastassunit}


This query creates a new area at the **"Assessment_unit"** level and inserts it into the `refbast.tr_area_are` table. It first identifies all river segments from the main stretch of the reach (`ord_clas = 1`) that intersect with a specific assessment unit (e.g. `Ass_unit = 1`). Then, using the `main_riv` outlet identifier, it retrieves all related river geometries. These river segments are used to locate the associated catchments from the `tempo.catchments_baltic` table via spatial intersection. The geometries of these catchments are merged using `ST_Union` and inserted as a single multipolygon. The resulting area is labeled with the name of the assessment unit (e.g. `'1 Northeastern Bothnian Bay'`), categorized under the `'Assessment_unit'` level, and marked as non-marine (`false`). This level references to `are_are_id` = 3 (@fig-inlandstocklvl).

#### River
Within each assessment unit, rivers are split depending on their outlet. This is used to select specific rivers within each assessment unit with ease.

The function `insert_area_are` creates entries at the **River** level in the `refbast.tr_area_are` table by aggregating catchments associated with rivers flowing through a given assessment unit. We begin by identifying all river outlet IDs (`main_riv`) from the dataset `tempo.riversegments_baltic` that intersect with the assessment unit (@fig-assunitlvl) defined by the input parameter `p_ass_unit`. Only the main stems of rivers, where `ord_clas = 1`, are considered to ensure consistent delineation.

Once the relevant river outlets are selected, we retrieve all associated river segments and then determine which catchments intersect with those segments. As multiple riversegments might intersect with one catchment, we remove duplicates by selecting a single instance per `hybas_id`. The resulting geometries are grouped by river outlet ID and merged into a single polygon using `ST_Union`.

These merged catchments are then inserted into the target table with their corresponding `main_bas` (that corresponds to the `main_riv` outlet id) used as the `are_code`, the `are_lev_code` is set to `River`, and the marine flag (`are_ismarine`) is set to false. This ensures that each outlet is associated with a unique, non-overlapping polygon representing its own river stretch.
Finally, `are_are_id` is linked to the corresponding `are_id` of each assessment unit.

#### River section

This query inserts entries at the **River_section** level in the `refbast.tr_area_are` table by splitting the main river areas into smaller sections. We start by selecting all polygons corresponding to rivers (`are_lev_code = 'River'`) to define the broader river areas that will serve as the parent units.

Next, river segments are selected from the `tempo.riversegments_baltic` table, focusing only on the main channels (`ord_clas = 1`). Each river segment (`hyriv_id`) is spatially matched to its parent river polygon using `ST_Intersects`, ensuring that each segment is properly linked to its broader river unit.

Each selected segment is then assigned a new `are_id` generated from the sequence `refbast.seq`, while the original `hyriv_id` from the river segment dataset is used as the `are_code`. The `are_lev_code` is set to `River_section`, and the marine flag (`are_ismarine`) is set to false. Only one unique entry per `hyriv_id` is inserted to avoid duplication, ensuring a clean and consistent representation of river sections within the database structure.

This structure is added into a table called `refnas.tr_area_are`.
As for **WGBAST** hierarchy, the first layer of the structure is the global Stock level (@fig-fullnas1). It includes all catchments that have a river flowing into areas studied by WGNAS (@fig-inlandnas1) as well as all ICES Subareas corresponding to said areas of interest (@fig-stcknas1). 

This query performs an update of the main **NEAC** area, corresponding to the record with the identifier (`are_id`) equal to `1`. It begins by merging (`ST_Union`) all geometries found in the `geom_polygon` column of the `refnas.tr_area_are` table, then creates a concave hull around this union using the `ST_ConcaveHull` function. The resulting geometry is filtered to retain only shapes with an area (`ST_Area`) greater than `1`, thereby eliminating artifacts or small fragments. The final `UPDATE` statement modifies the record with `are_id = 1`: the parent area reference (`are_are_id`) is set to `NULL`, the area code becomes simply `'NEAC'`, the level remains `'Stock'`, the marine status is left undefined (`are_ismarine = NULL`), the main geometry is replaced with the filtered shape converted into a multipolygon via `ST_Multi`, and the linear geometry (`geom_line`) is set to `NULL`.

## Marine level
### Stock

The first query inserts a new record into the `refnas.tr_area_are` table representing the marine area called **NEAC marine**. It begins with a `WITH` clause named `selected_level`, which aggregates (`ST_Union`) geometries from the `ref.tr_fishingarea_fia` table where the area level (`fia_level`) is `'Division'` and the area code (`fia_area`) is `'27'`. Specific divisions — `'27.3.b, c'` and `'27.3.d'` — are explicitly excluded from the selection. The resulting geometry (`geom`) is then inserted into the `geom_polygon` column. The area identifier (`are_id`) is automatically generated using a sequence (`nextval('refnas.seq')`), the parent area (`are_are_id`) is set to `1`, the area code (`are_code`) is set to `'NEAC marine'`, the level is defined as `'Stock'` (`are_lev_code`), the area is marked as marine (`are_ismarine = true`), and the line geometry (`geom_line`) is left empty (`NULL`).

Similarly, the second query inserts a marine area called **NAC marine** using the same structure. It also begins with a `WITH` clause named `selected_level`, which merges (`ST_Union(geom)`) geometries from the `ref.tr_fishingarea_fia` table, but this time focusing on area `'21'` at the `'Division'` level. The resulting unified geometry is used to populate the `geom_polygon` column. The area is assigned an auto-incremented `are_id`, no parent (`are_are_id = NULL`), an area code of `'NAC marine'`, a level `'Stock'`, is explicitly identified as marine (`are_ismarine = true`), and has no line geometry (`geom_line = NULL`).

This query inserts new entries into the `refnas.tr_area_are` table, each representing a **ICES marine subarea** within the broader fishing area `'27'`. It pulls source data from the `ref.tr_fishingarea_fia` table, filtering for rows where the area level (`fia_level`) is `'Subarea'` and the main area code (`fia_area`) is `'27'`. For each matching row, it extracts the subarea code (`fia_code`) to use as the new area code (`are_code`), and inserts the associated geometry (`geom`) into the `geom_polygon` column. The `are_id` is generated dynamically using the `refnas.seq` sequence, each inserted row is assigned the parent area ID `1` (`are_are_id = 1`), the level is marked as `'Subarea'` (`are_lev_code`), and all entries are flagged as marine (`are_ismarine = true`). The linear geometry field (`geom_line`) is not used and is therefore set to `NULL`.

### Division

This query inserts new records into the `refnas.tr_area_are` table, each corresponding to a **ICES marine division** within fishing area `'27'`. It retrieves division-level data (`fia_level = 'Division'`) from the `ref.tr_fishingarea_fia` table (aliased as `div`) and joins it with previously inserted **subarea** records from `refnas.tr_area_are` (aliased as `subarea`). The join condition reconstructs the subarea code by extracting the first and second components of the division code (`fia_code`), separated by periods, and concatenating them — effectively matching each division to its parent subarea based on shared code prefixes.

For each resulting pair, a new `are_id` is generated using `nextval('refnas.seq')`, and the parent area (`are_are_id`) is set to the matching subarea's `are_id`. The division code (`div.fia_code`) becomes the new area code (`are_code`), the level is explicitly set to `'Division'` (`are_lev_code`), and all divisions are marked as marine (`are_ismarine = true`). The corresponding geometry (`div.geom`) is inserted into the `geom_polygon` column, while `geom_line` is left empty (`NULL`).

### Assessment unit
After some disscussions with WGNAS, it was decided to use as Assessment units at sea postsmolt areas from [Olmos et al. (2021)](https://doi.org/10.1111/gcb.14913). Those areas are recreated as close as possible using ICES Division.

This query inserts a new spatial unit into the `refnas.tr_area_are` table, representing a **marine assessment unit** called **"postsmolt 1"**. It begins with a Common Table Expression (`WITH geomunion`) that selects and merges (`ST_Union`) the geometries (`geom`) from the `ref.tr_fishingarea_fia` table. The filter targets rows where the area level (`fia_level`) is `'Division'` and the division code (`fia_division`) matches one of the values in the array: `'21.4.X'`, `'21.4.W'`, or `'21.5.Y'`.

The resulting unified geometry is inserted as a single polygon into the `geom_polygon` column. A new area ID (`are_id`) is automatically generated using `nextval('refnas.seq')`, the parent area is set to `2` (`are_are_id = 2`), the area code is labeled `'postsmolt 1'`, and the level is defined as `'Assessment_unit'` via `are_lev_code`. The area is explicitly marked as marine (`are_ismarine = true`), and no line geometry is provided (`geom_line = NULL`).

### Fisheries
We decided to create a Fisheries level following work done by [WGNAS](https://diaspara.bordeaux-aquitaine.inrae.fr/deliverables/wp3/p4/wgnas_salmoglob_description.html#area) with their models. To create them we decided to follow fisheries areas present in [Olmos et al. (2021)](https://doi.org/10.1111/gcb.14913). 

This query updates an existing record in the `refnas.tr_area_are` table that represents the **"GLD fishery"**. It begins with a Common Table Expression (`WITH geomunion`) that selects and merges (`ST_Union`) the geometries (`geom`) from the `ref.tr_fishingarea_fia` table. It filters for entries where the area level (`fia_level`) is `'Division'` and the division code (`fia_division`) is one of the specified values: `'21.0.A'`, `'21.1.A'`, `'21.1.B'`, `'21.0.B'`, `'21.1.C'`, `'21.1.D'`, or `'21.1.E'`.
The merged geometry (`geom`) is then used in an `UPDATE` to overwrite the `geom_polygon` field of the area whose code (`are_code`) is `'GLD fishery'`. Additionally, the parent area reference (`are_are_id`) is updated and set to `4`.

### Stock
This query adds an entry named **NEAC inland** to the same table. It retrieves data from `tempo.catchments_nas`, a temporary table containing inland hydrographic features (`shape`). It selects only the records whose source table (dynamically extracted via `tableoid`) belongs to a specific set of tables such as `'h_barents'`, `'h_biscayiberian'`, `'h_celtic'`, etc. The selected shapes are merged using `ST_Union(shape)` to create a single polygon representing the inland part of the NEAC area. As before, a new `are_id` is generated, `are_are_id` is set to `1`, `are_code` is `'NEAC inland'`, the level remains `'Stock'`, `are_ismarine` is set to `false`, the geometry is inserted into `geom_polygon`, and `geom_line` is again set to `NULL`.

### Assessment unit
Following data from [WGNAS dataset](https://diaspara.bordeaux-aquitaine.inrae.fr/deliverables/wp3/p4/wgnas_salmoglob_description.html#area) and geometries from [Olmos et al. 2020](https://doi.org/10.1111/gcb.14913) we created inland assessment units around Europe and North America. 

The function `update_geom_from_wgnas` is designed to **update the geometry and parent area** of a specific assessment unit in the `refnas.tr_area_are` table based on data from the `janis.wgnas_su` table.

It takes two input parameters:
* `p_are_code` (`TEXT`): the code identifying the target area (`are_code`),
* `p_are_are_id` (`INT`): the new parent area ID to assign (`are_are_id`).
Inside the function, an `UPDATE` is performed on `refnas.tr_area_are` (aliased as `tgt`), where the `are_code` matches `p_are_code` and the level code (`are_lev_code`) is `'Assessment_unit'`. It joins with the `janis.wgnas_su` table (aliased as `src`), using the `su_ab` field to find the matching spatial unit. For the matching row, it updates the `geom_polygon` column with the geometry from `janis.wgnas_su.geom`, and sets the parent reference (`are_are_id`) to the value passed in `p_are_are_id`.

### River
The function `insert_river_areas_nas` inserts new river catchment areas into the `refnas.tr_area_are` table based on spatial intersections between major river segments (`ord_clas = 1`) from `tempo.riversegments_nas` and a given assessment unit (`p_ass_unit`) from `janis.wgnas_su`. It first identifies the relevant rivers, selects all segments belonging to them, and then determines which catchments (`main_bas`) intersect those segments. These catchments are merged into single geometries per basin, filtered to exclude those already present in the target table or explicitly listed in `p_excluded_id`, and inserted as new entries with a generated ID, a parent reference (`p_are_are_id`), the basin code as `are_code`, the level set to `'River'`, `are_ismarine` marked `false`, and the merged geometry stored in `geom_polygon`.
A similar function is created for North America as `insert_river_areas_nac`.

### River section
This query inserts new **river section** features into the `refnas.tr_area_are` table by identifying river segments that spatially intersect previously defined river-level areas. It begins with a Common Table Expression (`WITH`) named `river_level`, which selects the `are_id` and `geom_polygon` of all entries in `refnas.tr_area_are` where the level code (`are_lev_code`) is `'River'`. Then, in the `river_segments` CTE, it selects distinct river segments (`hyriv_id`) from `tempo.riversegments_nas` where the order class (`ord_clas`) is `1`—indicating main rivers—and which intersect any of the river-level geometries. For each intersecting segment, it prepares a new row: assigning a unique ID (`nextval('refnas.seq')`), linking it to the intersected river area via `are_are_id`, using the river segment ID as `are_code`, setting the level to `'River_section'`, marking it as non-marine (`false`), leaving `geom_polygon` empty (`NULL`), and storing the actual river geometry in `geom_line`. Finally, only one entry per `are_code` is retained using `DISTINCT ON`, ensuring no duplicates are inserted. This operation adds detailed linear representations of rivers, hierarchically linked to their corresponding catchment areas.

                options = list(dom = 't',

### Country
To add the country level, the same work has been done as for WGBAST (@sec-wgbast-country).

# EU-Hydro
## Data description
**EU-Hydro** is a pan-European hydrographic dataset developed under the Copernicus Land Monitoring Service. It provides a detailed and consistent interpretation of surface water bodies and river networks across 39 European Environment Agency (EEA) countries. Based on high-resolution remote sensing imagery from 2006, 2009, and 2012, EU-Hydro includes a photo-interpreted river network, inland water bodies, canals, and ditches. From version 1.2, it integrates river segments derived from the EU Digital Elevation Model (EU-DEM), improving the completeness and accuracy of the dataset. It serves as a key resource for environmental monitoring, water resource management, and hydrological studies at the European level.

```{r}
#| label: river segment variables
#| code-summary: Description of river segments variables
#| echo: TRUE
#| warning: FALSE
#| message: FALSE
#| tbl-cap: Variables description


data_description <- dbGetQuery(con_diaspara, 
  "SELECT cols.column_name AS var_name, 
        pgd.description AS description
  FROM information_schema.columns cols
  LEFT JOIN pg_catalog.pg_statio_all_tables st 
      ON st.schemaname = cols.table_schema AND st.relname = cols.table_name
  LEFT JOIN pg_catalog.pg_description pgd 
      ON pgd.objoid = st.relid AND pgd.objsubid = cols.ordinal_position
  WHERE cols.table_schema = 'e_gota'
  AND cols.table_name = 'euhydro_gota_v013 — River_Net_l';")

knitr::kable(data_description) %>% kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed"))

```

We will also be using a Nodes layer that contains informations on the source, the outlet and the branching tributaries of rivers.

## Importing EU-Hydro
To be decided. We cannot make it work at the moment

## Building the database
The EU-Hydro data is split into several schemas following main basins. River segments, canals, ditches and inland waters are divided into several tables. The first work will be done on river segments. Other data will be added later on.

![Map of river network from EU-Hydro split into basins.](images/fig-euhydrobase.png "A view of Europe river networks"){#fig-eubase}

The river network will be devided following the same idea as for HydroSHEDS'. ICES Areas and Ecoregions will be used as a base layer to create different schemas.

### Step 1 : Restructuring and fixing issues
To be able to properly integrate data to our database, some changes have been made on the data. To make those changes, functions have been created.

Firstly, the SRID and geometry had to be switched from 3035 to 4326 and from 3D to 2D (the z-dimension of the geometry being always equals to 0).

```{sql}
#| eval: FALSE
#| echo: TRUE
#| code-summary: Code to create a function that changes srid and geometry
#| warning: FALSE
#| message: FALSE

DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS altergeometry(basin TEXT);
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION altergeometry(basin TEXT)
RETURNS TABLE (table_name TEXT, srid INTEGER) AS
$$
DECLARE 
    schema_name TEXT := quote_ident('e_' || basin);
    river_table TEXT := quote_ident('euhydro_' || basin || '_v013 — River_Net_l');
    nodes_table TEXT := quote_ident('euhydro_' || basin || '_v013 — Nodes');
    sql_query TEXT;
BEGIN 
    sql_query := 
        'ALTER TABLE ' || schema_name || '.' || river_table || 
        ' ALTER COLUMN geom TYPE geometry(MultiLineString, 4326) 
          USING ST_Transform(ST_Force2D(geom), 4326);';
    EXECUTE sql_query;
    sql_query := 
        'ALTER TABLE ' || schema_name || '.' || nodes_table || 
        ' ALTER COLUMN geom TYPE geometry(Point, 4326) 
          USING ST_Transform(ST_Force2D(geom), 4326);';
    EXECUTE sql_query;

	RETURN QUERY EXECUTE 
        'SELECT ' || quote_literal(river_table) || ' AS table_name, srid 
         FROM (SELECT DISTINCT ST_SRID(geom) AS srid FROM ' || schema_name || '.' || river_table || ') sub
         UNION ALL 
         SELECT ' || quote_literal(nodes_table) || ' AS table_name, srid 
         FROM (SELECT DISTINCT ST_SRID(geom) AS srid FROM ' || schema_name || '.' || nodes_table || ') sub;';
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```

Then, a function to restructure the column order of the river segment tables was created to harmonise tables' structure between different basins.

```{sql}
#| eval: FALSE
#| echo: TRUE
#| code-summary: Code to restructure columns order
#| warning: FALSE
#| message: FALSE

DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS restructurecolumns(basin TEXT);
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION restructurecolumns(basin TEXT)
RETURNS VOID AS $$
DECLARE 
    schema_name TEXT := quote_ident('e_' || basin);
    source_table TEXT := quote_ident('euhydro_' || basin || '_v013 — River_Net_l');
    target_table TEXT := quote_ident('riverseg');
    sql_query TEXT;
BEGIN
    sql_query := 
        'CREATE TABLE ' || schema_name || '.' || target_table || ' AS SELECT ' ||
        '"OBJECTID",
         geom,
         "DFDD",
         "RN_I_ID",
         "REX",
         "HYP",
         "LOC",
         "FUN",
         "NVS",
         "LENGTH",
         "TR",
         "LONGPATH",
         "CUM_LEN",
         "PENTE",
         "CGNELIN",
         "BEGLIFEVER",
         "ENDLIFEVER",
         "UPDAT_BY",
         "UPDAT_WHEN",
         "ERM_ID",
         "MC",
         "MONOT_Z",
         "LENGTH_GEO",
         "INSPIRE_ID",
         "thematicId",
         "OBJECT_ID",
         "TNODE",
         "STRAHLER",
         "nameTxtInt",
         "nameText",
         "NEXTUPID",
         "NEXTDOWNID",
         "FNODE",
         "CatchID",
         "Shape_Length",
         "PFAFSTETTER" ' ||
        ' FROM ' || schema_name || '.' || source_table;

    EXECUTE sql_query;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```

Finally, indexes and unicity constraints are added to variables that will be used to divide the dataset as well as river segments ids.

```{sql}
#| eval: FALSE
#| echo: TRUE
#| code-summary: Code to retrieve all missing islands and coastal catchments
#| warning: FALSE
#| message: FALSE

DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS create_indexes_and_constraint(basin TEXT);
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION create_indexes_and_constraint(basin TEXT)
RETURNS VOID AS
$$
DECLARE 
    schema_name TEXT := quote_ident('e_' || basin);
    river_table TEXT := quote_ident('euhydro_' || basin || '_v013 — River_Net_l');
    sql_query TEXT;
BEGIN 
    sql_query := 
        'CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_t_node_' || basin || '_riv 
         ON ' || schema_name || '.' || river_table || ' USING btree("TNODE");';
    EXECUTE sql_query;
    sql_query := 
        'CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_next_did_' || basin || '_riv 
         ON ' || schema_name || '.' || river_table || ' USING btree("NEXTDOWNID");';
    EXECUTE sql_query;
    sql_query := 
        'CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_obj_id_' || basin || ' 
         ON ' || schema_name || '.' || river_table || ' USING btree("OBJECT_ID");';
    EXECUTE sql_query;
    sql_query := 
        'ALTER TABLE ' || schema_name || '.' || river_table || ' 
         ADD CONSTRAINT c_uk_object_id_' || basin || ' UNIQUE("OBJECT_ID");';
    EXECUTE sql_query;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```


### Step 2: Selecting outlets
We create the table `tempo.selected_tnodes_balt_3031` to identify river outlet nodes near ICES marine subdivisions 31 and 30 in the Baltic region. First, in the `select_outlet` CTE, we extract nodes where `"HYDRONODCT" = 'Outlet'` from the Neva, Angerman, Kemi, and Gota river networks. Then, in `ices_nodes`, we filter these outlet nodes by checking if they are within `ST_DWithin(sr.geom, ia.geom, 0.04)` of ICES marine areas. Finally, in `select_riv`, we retrieve river segments from `"euhydro_*_v013 — River_Net_l"` tables that are connected to the selected outlet nodes via `"TNODE" = ir."OBJECT_ID"`, ensuring only distinct entries are included in the final table.

```{sql}
#| eval: FALSE
#| echo: TRUE
#| code-summary: Code to retrieve river segments outlets for basins within range of ICES subdivisions 30 and 31
#| warning: FALSE
#| message: FALSE

DROP TABLE IF EXISTS tempo.selected_tnodes_balt_3031;
CREATE TABLE tempo.selected_tnodes_balt_3031 AS
WITH select_outlet AS (
    SELECT * FROM e_neva."euhydro_neva_v013 — Nodes" WHERE "HYDRONODCT" = 'Outlet'
    UNION ALL
    SELECT * FROM e_angerman."euhydro_angerman_v013 — Nodes" WHERE "HYDRONODCT" = 'Outlet'
    UNION ALL
    SELECT * FROM e_kemi."euhydro_kemi_v013 — Nodes" WHERE "HYDRONODCT" = 'Outlet'
    UNION ALL
    SELECT * FROM e_gota."euhydro_gota_v013 — Nodes" WHERE "HYDRONODCT" = 'Outlet'
),
ices_nodes AS (
    SELECT sr.*
    FROM select_outlet sr
    JOIN ices_areas.ices_areas_20160601_cut_dense_3857 AS ia
    ON ST_DWithin(sr.geom, ia.geom, 0.04)
    WHERE ia.subdivisio = ANY(ARRAY['31','30'])
),
select_riv AS (
    SELECT enr.*
    FROM e_neva."euhydro_neva_v013 — River_Net_l" enr
    JOIN ices_nodes ir ON enr."TNODE" = ir."OBJECT_ID"
    UNION ALL
    SELECT enr.*
    FROM e_angerman."euhydro_angerman_v013 — River_Net_l" enr
    JOIN ices_nodes ir ON enr."TNODE" = ir."OBJECT_ID"
    UNION ALL
    SELECT enr.*
    FROM e_kemi."euhydro_kemi_v013 — River_Net_l" enr
    JOIN ices_nodes ir ON enr."TNODE" = ir."OBJECT_ID"
    UNION ALL
    SELECT enr.*
    FROM e_gota."euhydro_gota_v013 — River_Net_l" enr
    JOIN ices_nodes ir ON enr."TNODE" = ir."OBJECT_ID"
)
SELECT DISTINCT ON ("OBJECT_ID") "OBJECT_ID" AS seaoutlet, select_riv.* FROM select_riv;
```

### Step 3: Merging basins
To facilitate the next query, all basins touching the selected ICES areas have been merged into a temporary table. While doing to the name of the basin is added to the table.

```{sql}
#| eval: FALSE
#| echo: TRUE
#| code-summary: Code to merge all riversegments into one table
#| warning: FALSE
#| message: FALSE

DROP TABLE IF EXISTS tempo.e_balt_3031;
CREATE TABLE tempo.e_balt_3031 AS(
	SELECT *, 'neva' AS basin FROM e_neva."euhydro_neva_v013 — River_Net_l"
	    UNION ALL
	    SELECT *, 'angerman' AS basin FROM e_angerman."euhydro_angerman_v013 — River_Net_l"
	    UNION ALL
	    SELECT *, 'kemi' AS basin FROM e_kemi."euhydro_kemi_v013 — River_Net_l"
	    UNION ALL
	    SELECT *, 'gota' AS basin FROM e_gota."euhydro_gota_v013 — River_Net_l"
);
```

### Step 4: Retrieving river segments
To facilitate the workflow we created a function to retrieve all river segments linked to the outlet segments. This function also modify all variables names to harmonize them with the rest of the database.

We create the function `makesegments(schema text, outlet_table text, segment_table text)` to recursively trace river segments upstream from specified outlet nodes. In the returned variables we decided to keep the `"OBJECT_ID"` of each outlet's river segment as `seaoutlet`. Inside the function, we define the recursive CTE `river_tree`, which starts by selecting river segments where `"TNODE"` matches `"TNODE"` from the outlet table. It then iteratively joins upstream segments using `"NEXTDOWNID"`, tracking depth and preventing cycles using `is_cycle` and `path`. Finally, we return all river segments along with their associated `seaoutlet`.

```{sql}
#| eval: FALSE
#| echo: TRUE
#| code-summary: Code to retrieve all river segments linked to preselected outlets
#| warning: FALSE
#| message: FALSE
